# Motivation
Personally, watching movies and animes is one of my hobbies and I want to explore the potential movies that may attract me. For this purpose, movie recommendation system could be a wonderful tool to help me figure out intertesting movies and enjoy my life.

For business insight, as the amount of movies,videos and the amount of movie platforms increase and there are diversity of tastes of users, it is difficult for users to explore the movies they prefer. A good movie recommendation system can help companies provide users with better movie watching experience and attract more users to their platform. Hence it is necessary to build a movie recommendation system.
